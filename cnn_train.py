# Training script for CNN models

# Should take in the following arguments:
    # Batch size
    # Learning rate
    # GPU/CPU
    # Batch Normalization
    # Data augmentation
    # Log directory
    # Checkpoint save directory
    # Epochs
    # Number of epochs to print
    # Number of epochs to save checkpoint
    # optimizer
    # And more, depending on model architecture

# Take a look at hico_train as well as datasets/processing_scripts/hico_run_faster_rcnn for inspiration; 
# you should be able to copy a significant amount of code from those two files.
